I am a Senior Data Scientist at the [Waldron Lab](https://waldronlab.io/) in
the [CUNY School of Public Health](https://sph.cuny.edu/) and Senior
Biostatistician for the [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) project
at [Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://roswellpark.org/).

As part of the Bioconductor core team, my work involves genomic data
structures and representations within the R/Bioconductor ecosystem. I am also
involved in the supporting software infrastructure of the Bioconductor group
such as BiocManager, BiocCheck, and BiocPkgTools.
I am the developer of `MultiAssayExperiment`, a widely-used integrative
container for representing and coordinating multiple 'omics experiments on a
set of samples.

At the CUNY SPH, I am involved in teaching introductory biostatistics and
programming courses to master-level students. These courses in R and SAS
provide practical data analysis and management experience to highly motivated
students.
