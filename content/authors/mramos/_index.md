I am a Senior Data Scientist in the [Waldron Lab](https://waldronlab.io/) at
the [CUNY School of Public Health](https://sph.cuny.edu/) and Senior
Biostatistician for the [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) project
at [Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://roswellpark.org/).

As part of the Bioconductor core team, my work involves implementing genomic
data structures and representations within the R / Bioconductor ecosystem. I am
also involved in supporting Bioconductor's software infrastructure such as
[BiocManager](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BiocManager),
[BiocCheck](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocCheck),
[BiocPkgTools](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocPkgTools), among others.

In consultation with the Multi-Assay Special Interest Group, I have developed,
[MultiAssayExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/MultiAssayExperiment),
a widely-used R / Bioconductor package that integrates and represents multiple
'omics experiments on a set of samples. For a full list of package projects,
see the `Packages` tab.

At CUNY SPH, I am involved in teaching introductory biostatistics and
programming courses to master-level students. These courses in R and SAS
provide practical analysis and management experience to highly motivated
students.
