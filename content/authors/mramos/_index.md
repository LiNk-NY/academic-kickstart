I am a Senior Data Scientist at
[CUNY School of Public Health](https://sph.cuny.edu/) and Senior
Biostatistician for the [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) project
at [Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://roswellpark.org/).
I have been part of [Levi Waldron's Lab](https://waldronlab.io/)
for about 5 years.

My interests include genomic data representations and manipulations in
Bioconductor. With the help of the Bioconductor Multi-assay Special Interest
Group, I've developed `MultiAssayExperiment`, an integrative container to
represent and coordinate multiple experiments on a set of samples.

I also teach introductory biostatistics and programming courses at
CUNY SPH, which I enjoy. These courses in R and SAS provide practical data
analysis and management experience to highly motivated MPH
students. I also provide individual assistance to students who are working on
culminating graduate degree activities.
