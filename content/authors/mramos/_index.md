I am a Senior Data Scientist at
[CUNY School of Public Health](https://sph.cuny.edu/) and a Senior
Biostatistician for the [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) project
at [Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://roswellpark.org/). I am a
senior member of the [Waldron Lab](https://waldronlab.io/) led by Levi Waldron,
PhD.

I enjoy teaching introductory biostatistics and programming courses at
CUNY SPH. I teach R and SAS intensive summer courses to highly motivated MPH
students who want to gain practical experience with data analysis and data
management. I meet individually with students who need assistance with research
projects and culminating MPH / DrPH activities.
