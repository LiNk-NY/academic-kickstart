I am a Research Associate at [CUNY SPH](https://sph.cuny.edu/) and a
Biostatistician for the [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) project at
[Roswell Park CCC](https://roswellpark.org/). I am a senior member of the
[Waldron Lab](https://waldronlab.io/) led by Levi Waldron, PhD.

I enjoy teaching introductory biostatistics and programming courses at the
CUNY School of Public Health. I teach R and SAS summer courses to MPH students
who are highly motivated to gain practical experience with data analysis and
management. I also provide students with one-on-one assistance with research
projects and culminating MPH activities.
